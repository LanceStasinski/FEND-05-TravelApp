# FEND-05-TravelApp

 This application is meant to demonstrate the skills learned from Udacity's FEND nanodegree program. These skills include working with: HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript (asynchronous), express servers, external APIs through GET and POST requests, webpack, service workers, and more. The application should take in a data and location from the user and return the weather report for that place and time.
